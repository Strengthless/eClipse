<h2>Clarification regarding IP logs</h2>
Yes. There are IP loggers on certain parts of my website.

However, IP logging is **only** implemented when the webpage is for, 
- Internal usage, and
- When user identification is necessary.

As of the time of writing, IP logging has only been implemented twice.
- The `compromised` branch, as it requires accessing external API services, and was only developed for myself and a few friends. However, the IP logger has been removed, since the `92570f` commit.
- The `qr` branch, as it was a `QR code hunt` game which was designed for an event, and game progress of each player had to be tracked. The event has now ended, and the IP logger has not received any data since 16/11/2020.


All information are stored in a secure database, where only I have access to. 

Your data will **not** be accessed by others, nor any third parties.

I would like to apologize for not being sensitive enough, and not having this cleared up a long time ago. 

If you're still concerned or have any complaints, feel free to open an issue or contact me on Discord, via `Strengthless#8282`.

Thank you.
